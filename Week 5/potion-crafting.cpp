/*Your task is to write a program that asks the user which potion they would like to prioritizeâ€”Health or Magic. 
If the user enters an invalid number for the type of potion, the program should ask them to re-enter like this: Invalid input. 
Please select 1 or 2. The program will then prompt the user to input the number of each ingredient they currently have (Tealeaves, 
Sunflowers, Toadstools, and Pine Needles). Based on the available ingredients, calculate how many potions of the priority type can be crafted. 
Any leftover ingredients should be used to craft as many of the other types of potion as possible. Finally, the program should output how 
many of the priority potions can be crafted and how many of the other potions can be made with the remaining ingredients.

The ingredient requirements for each type of potion are as follows:
Ingredients 	Amount for Health Potion 	Amount for Magic Potion
Tealeaves 	        6 	                    2
Sunflowers 	        1 	                    3
Toadstools      	5 	                    10
Pine Needles 	    2 	                    1*/
