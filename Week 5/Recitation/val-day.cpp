/*Recitation Valentine’s Day! - Problem 7

At the Violet Peak Cafe in CU Boulder, the arrival of valentine’s week means it’s time to stock up on specialty coffee beans and syrups.
To efficiently manage storage, the cafe uses two types of containers:

    Cylindrical Containers for large batches of coffee beans.
    Spherical Containers for special red velvet mocha syrup.

The manager wants to calculate the volume of each container to ensure they have enough storage capacity before the season begins.
Your task is to help them by writing two functions that accurately calculate the volumes of the containers.
*/

/*
@brief Calculates the volume of a cylindrical container
@param radius Radius of the base
@param height Height of the cylinder
@return double - volume of the cylindrical container
*/
double calculateCylindricalVolume(double radius, double height) { /* Your code goes here. */ }

/*
@brief Calculates the volume of a spherical container
@param radius Radius of the sphere
@return double - volume of the spherical container
*/
double calculateSphericalVolume(double radius) { /* Your code goes here. */ }

Recitation Valentine’s Day! - Problem 7.a.: Algorithm

Write out the steps you would use to solve this problem by hand as pseudocode.

   
Recitation Valentine’s Day! - Problem 7.b.: Examples

Pick two possible inputs for each of your two functions (four total). Follow the steps you wrote for these values to find your result, and verify it.

   
Recitation Valentine’s Day! - Problem 7.c.: Assert Statements

Translate your inputs and expected outputs into assert statements.

   
Recitation Valentine’s Day! - Problem 7.d.: Implementation

Translate your pseudocode into a C++ program to solve the above code, using your assert statements in your main function to
verify that your program works as expected.
