Start
  Declare an integer variable `m` and initialize it to -1.
  Declare an integer variable `i` and initialize it to 0.
  While `i` is less than 5, do:
    Declare an integer variable `s` and initialize it to 1.
    If `i` is not 0 and the remainder of `i` divided by 3 is 0, then:
      Multiply `s` by -1 and assign the result back to `s`.
      Print the product of `m` and `s`.
    Else:
      Increment `m` by 2.
      Print the value of `m`.
    Increment `i` by one.
