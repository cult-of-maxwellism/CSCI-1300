/*Write a function that accepts two 2x3 
integer arrays as input parameters and displays the sum matrix (displayed in 2 rows). Example header:

void matrixSum(int a[2][3], int b[2][3])

Then, create a main() function that asks the user to input the values for each matrix one row at a time. 
Store these in two arrays, and pass them to matrixSum. Example output (red is user input)*/
